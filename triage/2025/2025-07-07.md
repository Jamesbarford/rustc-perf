Second commit benchmarked on new machine. The regressed benchmarks are small and fairly aritifical. Some of the results look like noise and returned to previous state. I don't think this is worth investigating more.

Seems like overhead of the measurement. Pinged the author, but seems like we can't do much about that.

Most of the regressions are probably safe to ignore (small, secondary or noise). The biggest one is in cargo, where the regression is in LLVM, which indicates something probably changed in relation to optmizations or codegen scheduling. Most of the changes here seem unrelated, though. I suspect it could be one of the standard library changes in first three PRs.

This seems to have returned back to previous state with a little improvement on top in https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/143509, detailed results show inverse numbers on the same LLVM-related queries, but since that PR changed mir optimizations, it probably has some effect on that, too.

`clap_derive` improvement is bimodal noise. `ripgrep` regression doesn't make sense to me. We either do less work or the same amount of work here (not sure which debuginfo option we use for this benchmark). Wall time has no relevant changes, though, so I assume it's spurious.

Regressions outweigh improvements. Note that lot of the regressions are on very small benchmarks, so the negative effects are somewhat exagerrated. Based on PR description, this change also targets worspace use case that is not represented well in our benchmarks.

Pre merge results don't match post merge results. Most regressions are in doc benchmarks, impact seems quite low. I left a comment asking for next steps.

Improvements outweigh regressions, changes are tiny. `coercions` regressions seems to be noise. I don't think this is worth digging into.
